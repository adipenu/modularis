While autonomous robots have seen significant research advancements in recent years, due to the harsh nature 
of underwater environment, there is limited availability in finding off-the-shelf underwater robots for various 
applications. Custom-built underwater robots may be necessary for specialized applications or missions, but the 
process can be more costly, time-consuming, and requiring expert knowledge. This challenge makes validation and 
verification process difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a modular underwater robot that can serve 
as an open-source testbed system that is customizable and subject to environmental variability.
