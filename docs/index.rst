Purpose
---------------------------

Modularis was designed for developers, as a underwater sensing platform to launch from for validating 
autonomous mapping and planning algorithms.

We saw a lack in availability of affordable underwater vrobots which could easily be used for mapping and planning research.
Our lab needed a vehicle that was multipurpose; capable of equiping a wide suite of sensors without having to make time-consuming
modifications. The idea for Modularis was born from this need. 

Advantages and Limitations
----------------------------

- Easily modifyable software for implementing custom controllers, perception algorithms, and planners
- Designed to work with multiple embedded systems, such as the Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, and TDA4VM-SDK
- Tethered and untethered missions
- Long battery life using two liPo batteries

Specifications
---------------------------------

- Operating depth of up to 100m
- 6 thruster configuration
- 2 LiPo batteries

.. While autonomous robots have seen significant research advancements in recent years, due to the harsh nature 
.. of underwater environment, there is limited availability in finding off-the-shelf underwater robots for various 
.. applications. Custom-built underwater robots may be necessary for specialized applications or missions, but the 
.. process can be more costly, time-consuming, and requiring expert knowledge. This challenge makes validation and 
.. verification process difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a modular underwater robot that can serve 
.. as an open-source testbed system that is customizable and subject to environmental variability.
