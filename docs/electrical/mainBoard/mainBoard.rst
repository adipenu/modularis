Main Printed Circuit Board
=============================

The main board contains the on-board
computer of the userâ€™s choice and uses header pins
for external debugging. Connections for the power
and IMU boards are also available with a Molex
connector. The PCA96585PW PWM Driver is an
I2C-based chip that talks to the computer that
controls the PWM signals for each ESC thruster and
the camera servo.
